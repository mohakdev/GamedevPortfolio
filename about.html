        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>I am a solo indie game developer based in India. I love to play and make games. 
        I love being able to design and develop interactive experiences that can be enjoyed globally by a wide range of different audiences. 
        I also love being able to create and experiment with the development of indie tools, as it gives me a chance to try and give back to 
        the community I work in and hopefully make the lives of my fellow developers easier.</p>
        <h1>Work Experience</h1>
        <p>I have been in the game development industry for about more than 1 year now. Before using Unity to make games, 
        I used to make games in Roblox Studio. I have published several games in Roblox and earned Robux from them. 
        I switched to Unity about 8 months ago so I am quite familiar with Unity.  I have also participated in UDC Game Jam where I came in third place. 
        I have released several games on Itch.Io and also made some really awesome prototypes. One of my best prototypes is Floor is Lava. 
        In that game, you need to figure out a way to escape the room before it is flooded with Lava.</p>
