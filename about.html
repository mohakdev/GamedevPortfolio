        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>
            Hello I am Mohak Jain and I am 15 years old. I am a indie game developer , web developer and a student based in India.
            I love being able to make games which people can enjoy and have fun playing.
            I am really interested in Programming, especially  web development and game development. I Love to work on quick, small projects with people.
        </p>
        <h1>Work Experience</h1>
        <p>I have been in the game development industry for about more than 1 year now. Before using Unity to make games, 
        I used to make games in Roblox Studio. I have published several games in Roblox and earned Robux from them. 
        I switched to Unity about 8 months ago so I am quite familiar with Unity.  I have also participated in UDC Game Jam where I came in third place. 
        I have released several games on Itch.Io and also made some really awesome prototypes. One of my best prototypes is Floor is Lava. 
        In that game, you need to figure out a way to escape the room before it is flooded with Lava.</p>
